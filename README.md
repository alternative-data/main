Alternative data has become increasingly insightful in recent years. I will be using this GitHub account to share alternative datasets that can be used in analyzing economics, industries, companies, etc. For example, one may be able to gain insight into Fitbit by knowing how many Fitbit apps have been downloaded.

The data will mostly be from the web or crowdsourced. Suggestions are appreciated. Some examples of data that will be posted here are: lists of the address of a restaurant, historic app download data, bestselling items data, data from SEC and other government filings, etc.
